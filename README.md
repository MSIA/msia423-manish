## Project Charter
<!-- toc -->
### Vision 
This project is an attempt to build a chat based ETL tool. While the Extraction functionalities can be added to complete the tool, for current work only Transformation and Loading aspect of data pipeline will be done. Idea is for the tool to be chat based where a user inputs his requirement in simple plain english (few words or a sentence) and the tool performs the action. Example : User inputs " I want to join 2 tables". The tool should understand that a join operation is to be carried out and based on it ask for necessary inputs from the user. A sequence of transformation will be carried out on intermediate dataframes to build the complete datapipeline based on user's input in english sentences. 

### Mission
The tool will help avoid writing multiple scripts. Will particularly be useful for people with not much of a technical background to play with data. 

### Success Criteria
For the text classification (mapping the sentences to ETL operation) a high precision is necessary. An accuracy of over 90% is necessary for the tool to be usable. With more user entries the data will keep on expanding in the ideal scenario. (This feature will not be incorporated. The model will be trained once on a data prepared manually) 
Once the right transformation is identified the execution of those transformations should be performed correctly. The transformation functionalities may not end up being exhaustive but an attempt will be to cover a decent number of operations.

## Sprint Plan
### Initiative 1 : Loading demo Data on cloud, building data for text classification training
#### Epic-1 
* Story 1: Install Docker, anaconda and python libraries
* Story 2: Perform an end to end run of pennylane to check the availability of every requirement
#### Epic-2
* Story 1: Identify the right platform to host data ( Redshift - AWS or BigQuery- GCP)
* Story 2: Create a Dataset (A collection of related tables)
#### Epic-3
* Story 1: Create data manually for the text classification
* Story 2: Split the dataset into train and test

### Initiative 2 : Model training
#### Epic1
* Story 1: Choosing the right vectoriser (count or tf-idf should suffice, as corpus size should not be huge for current study)
* Story 2: Perform standard text cleaning
#### Epic2
* Story 1: Train the model on the set and check for its accuracy
* Story 2: Save the model in pickel format

### Initiative 3 : Generic script for carrying out ETL operation, Integration with front end
#### Epic-1
* Story 1: Python script having generalized function to perform operation on the relational tables 
* Story 2: Shell script to wrap all the functionalities in one
#### Epic-2
* Story 1: Build the front end app
* Story 2: Performing sanity check using test cases

## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database with a single song 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` with one initial song, run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db` with the initial song *Radar* by Britney spears. 
#### Adding additional songs 
To add an additional song:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.
